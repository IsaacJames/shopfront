# shopfront

This web application models a simple online shop front. Users are able to select items from a stock list and view a dynamic breakdown of the order price and any additional charges. If the order is placed, the web page is modified to display a confirmation of the order details, prompting the user to submit or re-edit the order. On submission, the order details are sent to the server where a receipt is generated and displayed. Validation of order details occurs on both client-side (with contextual popover messages indicating the desired format of an invalid input) and server-side (where a receipt will notify the user if the order is rejected).
